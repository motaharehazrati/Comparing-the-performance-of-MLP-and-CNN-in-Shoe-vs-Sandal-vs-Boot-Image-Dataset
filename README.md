# Comparing-the-performance-of-MLP-and-CNN-in-Shoe-vs-Sandal-vs-Boot-Image-Dataset
Initially, I partitioned the dataset into distinct training and test sets. Subsequently, I meticulously crafted a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network, thoughtfully incorporating dropout layers to mitigate overfitting. In parallel, I formulated a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an equivalent number of parameters. The primary objective of this undertaking was to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of these networks, meticulously assessing their performance in terms of error rates and precision. Additionally, I leveraged TensorBoard to facilitate the evaluation process.
